# TimelineButtonsInDopesheet
Addon for blender which adds various buttons from timeline into the dopesheet.

Sadly it does show in the normal timeline too making the timeline a bit more hefty because they seem to be the same window somehow, on the bright side they won't push buttons away and just go off screen if you need to shrink that window.
